# Project-Guide
This is a guide to all of the projects I have worked on, am working on, or plan to be working on, it also has projects I want to do but haven’t planned yet and the state of what’s happening with that project. Every project has a google doc, link to the Github page it’s being done in, it’s state, it’s description and more
